Description: A comprehensive set of indexes and tests for social segregation analysis,
              as described in Tivadar (2019) - 'OasisR': An R Package to Bring Some Order
              to the World of Segregation Measurement <doi:10.18637/jss.v089.i07>.
              The package  is the most complete existing tool and it clarifies
              many ambiguities and errors regarding the definition of segregation
              indices. Additionally, 'OasisR' introduces several resampling methods
              that enable testing their statistical significance
              (randomization tests, bootstrapping, and jackknife methods).
