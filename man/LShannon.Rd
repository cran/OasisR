\title{A function to compute Shannon-Wiener local diversity (entropy) index}
\usage{
LShannon(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a group within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population, because this will be interpreted as a group.}
}
\value{
A vector containing the local Shannon-Wiener diversity index 
values for each spatial unit
}
\description{
The Shannon-Wiener diversity index is based on 
the notion of entropy and measures population heterogeneity.

\examples{
