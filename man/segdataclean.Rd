\title{A function to clean and prepare the data for segregation analysis}
\usage{
segdataclean (x, c = NULL, b = NULL, a = NULL, p = NULL, 
ck = NULL, d = NULL, dc = NULL, spatobj = NULL, folder = NULL, shape = NULL, 
warnings = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a group within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population, because this will be interpreted as a group.}

\item{c}{a standard binary contiguity (adjacency) symmetric matrix where 
each element \emph{Cij} equals 1 if \emph{i}-th and \emph{j}-th spatial 
units are adjacent, and 0 otherwise.}

\item{b}{a common boundaries matrix where each element \emph{Bij}}

\item{a}{a numeric vector containing spatial unit areas}

\item{p}{a numeric vector containing spatial units perimeters.}

\item{ck}{a list containing contiguity matrices coresponding to each order 
(from 1 to K)}

\item{d}{a matrix of the distances between spatial unit centroids}

\item{dc}{a numeric vector containing the distances between spatial units
centroids and the central spatial unit}

\item{spatobj}{a spatial object (SpatialPolygonsDataFrame) with 
geographic information}

\item{folder}{a character vector with the folder (directory) 
name indicating where the shapefile is located on the drive}

\item{shape}{a character vector with the name of the shapefile 
(without the .shp extension).}

\item{warnings}{- warning alert (by default TRUE)}
}
\value{
The objects (data matrix, geographical vectors/matrices, spatial objects)
cleaned from null rows or columns
}
\description{
The function cleans and prepares the data for segregation analysis
