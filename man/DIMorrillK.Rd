\title{A function to compute K-th order Morrill's dissimilarity index}
\usage{
DIMorrillK(x, ck = NULL, queen = FALSE, spatobj = NULL, 
folder = NULL, shape = NULL, K = 2, f = 'exp', beta = 1, prec = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a group within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population, because this will be interpreted as a group.}

\item{ck}{a list with contiguity matrix for each order (from 1 to K)}

\item{queen}{logical parameter difining criteria used for contiguity 
matrix computation, TRUE for queen, FALSE (by default) for rook}

\item{spatobj}{a spatial object (SpatialPolygonsDataFrame) with 
geographic information}

\item{folder}{a character vector with the folder (directory) 
name indicating where the shapefile is located on the drive}

\item{shape}{a character vector with the name of the shapefile 
(without the .shp extension) .}

\item{K}{contiguity matrix order}

\item{f}{the distance function, f = 'exp' (by default) for negative 
exponential function and f = 'rec' for reciprocal function}

\item{beta}{distance decay parameter}

\item{prec}{precision parameter. If not NULL, the function stop computing
the spatial interaction when the impact on the indice is bellow 10 ^ (-prec)}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the Generalized Morrill's dissimilarity index 
values for each pair of groups
}
\description{
This function compute an adaptation of Morrill's dissimilarity 
index which takes into account the interactions between spatial units
defined by K order contiguity matrix. The function can be used in two ways: 
to provide a contiguity matrix or a external geographic information source 
(spatial object or shape file).

\examples{
x <- segdata@data[ ,1:2]
foldername <- system.file('extdata', package = 'OasisR')
shapename <- 'segdata'

DIMorrillK(x, spatobj = segdata, queen = FALSE, K = 3)

DIMorrillK(x, folder = foldername, shape = shapename, K = 4, f = 'rec')
