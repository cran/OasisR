\title{A function to compute the between group version of segregation Gini index}
\usage{
Gini2(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a group within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population, because this will be interpreted as a group.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the between-group Gini index values for 
each pair of groups
}
\description{
The between group version of Gini index is obtained 
by computing the index for a subpopulation formed by each pair of groups
}
\examples{
x <- segdata@data[ ,1:2]
Gini2(x)
}
