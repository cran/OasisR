\title{A function to compute Gini's segregation index}
\usage{
Gini(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a group within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population, because this will be interpreted as a group.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing Gini's segregation index values for each group
}
\description{
The segregation version of the Gini index can be derived from 
the Lorenz curve as the area between the segregation curve and the 
diagonal.
}
\examples{
x <- segdata@data[ ,1:2]
Gini(x)
}
