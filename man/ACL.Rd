\title{A function to compute Absolute Clustering Index (ACL)}
\usage{
ACL(x, spatmat = 'c', c = NULL, queen = FALSE, d = NULL, distin = 'm',  
distout = 'm', diagval = '0', beta = 1, spatobj = NULL, folder = NULL, shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a group within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population, because this will be interpreted as a group.}

\item{spatmat}{the method used for spatial calculations: 'c' for the 
contiguity matrix (by default) or any other user spatial interaction matrix 
and 'd' for the inverse exponential function of the distance.}

\item{c}{a modified binary contiguity (adjacency) symmetric matrix where 
each element \emph{Cij} equals 1 if \emph{i}-th and \emph{j}-th spatial 
units are adjacent or identical, and 0 otherwise.}

\item{queen}{logical parameter difining criteria used for contiguity 
matrix computation, TRUE for queen, FALSE (by default) for rook}

\item{d}{a matrix of the distances between spatial unit centroids}

\item{distin}{input metric conversion, based on  \pkg{bink} package and 
includes conversions from 'm', 'km', 'inch', 'ft', 'yd', 'mi', 'naut_mi', etc.}

\item{distout}{output metric conversion, based on  \pkg{bink} package and 
includes conversions to 'm', 'km', 'inch', 'ft', 'yd', 'mi', 'naut_mi', etc.}

\item{diagval}{when providing a spatial object or a shape file, 
the user has the choice of the spatial matrix diagonal definition: 
diagval = '0' (by default) for an null diagonal and diagval = 'a' 
to compute the diagonal as 0.6 * square root (spatial/organizational unitsarea) (White, 1983)}

\item{beta}{distance decay parameter}

\item{spatobj}{a spatial object (SpatialPolygonsDataFrame) with 
geographic information}

\item{folder}{a character vector with the folder (directory) 
name indicating where the shapefile is located on the drive}

\item{shape}{a character vector with the name of the shapefile 
(without the .shp extension).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the Absolute Clustering index values 
for each group
}
\description{
The absolute clustering index, ACL, expresses the 
average number of a group's members in nearby spatial units, as 
a proportion of the total population in those spatial units. 
The spatial interactions can be expressed as a contiguity matrix 
(with diagonal equal to 1), as an inverse exponential function of the 
distance between spatial units centers (with diagonal equal 
to 0.6 of the square root of each spatial units area) or other 
user specified interaction matrix. The function can be used in two 
ways: to provide a spatial interactions matrix (a contiguity matrix 
or a distance matrix) or a external  geographic information source 
(spatial object or shape file).

\examples{
x <- segdata@data[ ,1:2]
contiguity <- contig(segdata)
diag(contiguity) <- 1
ar<-area(segdata)
dist <- distance(segdata)
diag(dist)<-sqrt(ar) * 0.6
foldername <- system.file('extdata', package = 'OasisR')
shapename <- 'segdata'

ACL(x, c = contiguity) 

ACL(x, spatobj = segdata)

ACL(x, spatmat = 'd', folder = foldername, shape = shapename) 
 
ACL(x,  spatmat = 'd', diagval = 'a', spatobj = segdata)

ACL(x, d = dist, spatmat = 'd')
