\title{A function to compute Relatice Centralisation Index (RCE)}
\usage{
RCE(x, dc = NULL, center = 1, spatobj = NULL, folder = NULL, shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{- an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a population group, within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
population groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population in each unit, because this will be interpreted as a group.}

\item{dc}{- a numeric vector containing the distances between spatial units 
centroids and the central spatial unit}

\item{center}{- a numeric value giving the number of the spatial unit that 
represents the centre in the table}

\item{spatobj}{- a spatial object (SpatialPolygonsDataFrame) containing 
geographic information}

\item{folder}{- a character vector with the folder (directory) 
name indicating where the shapefile with the geographic information 
is located.}

\item{shape}{- a character vector with the name of the shapefile 
(without the .shp extension) which contains the geographic information}
}
\value{
a matrix containing relative centralisation index values
}
\description{
The relative centralisation index measures the 
proportion of a group that should change its localization to 
achieve the same level of centralization as another group.
The function can be used in two ways: to provide a vector containing 
the distances between spatial units centroids or a external geographic 
information source (spatial object or shape file).
}
\examples{
x <- segdata@data[ ,1:2]
distc<- distcenter(segdata, center = 45)
foldername <- system.file('extdata', package = 'OasisR')
shapename <- 'segdata'

RCE(x, dc=distc) 

RCE(x, spatobj = segdata, center = 45) 

RCE(x, folder = foldername, shape = shapename, center = 45)
