\title{A function to compute location quotients (LQs)}
\usage{
LQ(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{- an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a population group, within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
population groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population in each unit, because this will be interpreted as a group.}
}
\value{
a matrix of location quotiens
}
\description{
Location quotients compare the relative part of a 
group in a particular spatial unit, to the relative part of that 
same group in the area.
}
\examples{
x <- segdata@data[ ,1:2]
LQ(x)
