\title{A function to compute Morrill's segregation index}
\usage{
ISMorrill(x, c = NULL, queen = FALSE, 
spatobj = NULL, folder = NULL, shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a group within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population, because this will be interpreted as a group.}

\item{c}{a standard binary contiguity (adjacency) symmetric matrix where 
each element \emph{Cij} equals 1 if \emph{i}-th and \emph{j}-th spatial 
units are adjacent, and 0 otherwise.}

\item{queen}{a logical parameter difining criteria used for the contiguity 
matrix computation, TRUE for queen, FALSE (by default) for rook}

\item{spatobj}{a spatial object (SpatialPolygonsDataFrame) with 
geographic information}

\item{folder}{a character vector with the folder (directory) 
name indicating where the shapefile is located on the drive}

\item{shape}{a character vector with the name of the shapefile 
(without the .shp extension) .}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing Morrill's segregation index values for 
each group
}
\description{
Morrill's segregation index is a development of 
\code{\link{ISDuncan}}'s index which takes into account the 
interactions between spatial units(contiguity). 
The function can be used in two ways: to provide a contiguity 
matrix or a external geographic information source (spatial object 
or shape file).
}
\examples{
x <- segdata@data[ ,1:2]
contiguity <- contig(segdata)
foldername <- system.file('extdata', package = 'OasisR')
shapename <- 'segdata'

ISMorrill(x, c = contiguity) 

ISMorrill(x, spatobj = segdata)

ISMorrill(x, folder = foldername, shape = shapename)
