\title{A function to compute interaction index (xPy)}
\usage{
xPy(x, exact = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a group within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population, because this will be interpreted as a group.}

\item{exact}{a logical variable to specifiy the index version: 
exact = FALSE (by default) for the approximate version of the index, 
and exact = TRUE for the exact version}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the interaction index values for each 
pair of groups
}
\description{
The interaction index, xPy, is an exposure 
between groups index which measures the probability that a member 
of a group shares the same spatial unit with a member of another 
group. The index can be calculated with the approximate or exact 
method (see Bell, 1954).
