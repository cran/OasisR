\title{A function to compute Absolute Concentration index (ACO)}
\usage{
ACO(x, a = NULL, spatobj = NULL, folder = NULL, shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{- an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a population group, within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
population groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population in each unit, because this will be interpreted as a group.}

\item{a}{- a numeric vector containing the areas of spatial units}

\item{spatobj}{- a spatial object (SpatialPolygonsDataFrame) containing 
geographic information}

\item{folder}{- a character vector with the folder (directory) 
name indicating where the shapefile with the geographic information 
is located.}

\item{shape}{- a character vector with the name of the shapefile 
(without the .shp extension) which contains the geographic information}
}
\value{
a numeric vector containing Absolute Concentration index value for 
each population group
}
\description{
The absolute concentration index, ACO, computes 
the total area inhabited by a group, and compares the result 
to the minimum and maximum possible areas that could be 
inhabited by that group in the study area. 
#' The function can be used in two ways: to provide an area vector or a 
external geographic information source (spatial object or shape file).
}
\examples{
x <- GreHSize@data[ ,3:5]
ar <- area(GreHSize)
foldername <- system.file('extdata', package = 'OasisR')
shapename <- 'GreHSize'

ACO(x, a = ar) 

ACO(x, spatobj = GreHSize)

ACO(x, folder = foldername, shape = shapename)
