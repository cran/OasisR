\title{A function to compute the Massey and Denton Absolute Centralisation Index (ACE)}
\usage{
ACE(x, a = NULL, dc = NULL, center = 1, 
spatobj = NULL, folder = NULL, shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a group within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population, because this will be interpreted as a group.}

\item{a}{a numeric vector containing spatial unit areas}

\item{dc}{a numeric vector containing the distances between spatial units
centroids and the central spatial unit}

\item{center}{a numeric value giving the number of the spatial unit that 
represents the center in the table}

\item{spatobj}{a spatial object (SpatialPolygonsDataFrame) with 
geographic information}

\item{folder}{a character vector with the folder (directory) 
name indicating where the shapefile is located on the drive}

\item{shape}{a character vector with the name of the shapefile 
(without the .shp extension).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the Massey and Denton absolute 
centralisation index values for each group
}
\description{
The absolute centralization index measures a group
spatial distribution compared to the distribution of land area 
around the city center. The function can be used in two ways: to provide 
an area vector and a vector containing the distances between spatial units
centroids and  the central spatial unit or a external geographic information 
source (spatial object or shape file).
}
\examples{
x <- segdata@data[ ,1:2]
ar<-area(segdata)
distc<- distcenter(segdata, center = 28)
foldername <- system.file('extdata', package = 'OasisR')
shapename <- 'segdata'

ACE(x, a = ar, dc=distc) 

ACE(x, spatobj = segdata, center = 28) 

ACE(x, folder = foldername, shape = shapename, center = 28)
