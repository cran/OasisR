\title{A function to compute rank-ordered segregation indices}
\usage{
rankorderseg(x, polorder = 4, pred = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a group within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population, because this will be interpreted as a group. The rows
represent the nominal categories (spatial units) and the columns the population
distribution as ordered groups divided by thresholds}

\item{polorder}{order of the polynomial approximation (4 by default)}

\item{pred}{a numerical vector with percentiles to be predicted. 
If NULL, the predictions are made at threshold levels}
}
\value{
A list containing the results for three rank-ordered indices: 
rank-order information theory index (Hr), rank-order variation ratio 
index (Rr) and rank-order square root index (Sr). For each index, a sublist 
is provided, containing: 
Index (the rank-ordered index value), 
Hp/Rp/Sp (a vector containing the ordinal information theory/variance 
ratio/square root segregation index values at thresholds), 
Coefficients (the coefficients extracted from the polynomial estimation model,
including basic statistics), 
Predict (a list containing predicted values of the corresponding ordinal index (fit); 
standard error of predicted means (se.fit); degrees of freedom for residual (df); 
and residual standard deviations (residuale.scale). If pred is NULL, the function 
will return the statistics at thresholds)

\examples{
x1 <- matrix(nrow = 4, ncol = 7)
x1[1,] <- c( 10,  10, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
x1[2,] <- c( 0, 20, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20)
x1[3,] <- c(10, 20,  10, 10, 10, 0, 0 )
x1[4,] <- c(30, 30,  20, 10, 10, 0, 0 )
x2 <- x1
x2[,c(3,4,6,7)] <- x1[,c(6,7,3,4)]

rankorderseg(x1)
rankorderseg(x2, pred = seq(0, 1, 0.1))
